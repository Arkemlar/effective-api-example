# effective-api-example
This repo demonstrates my vision of making lightweight yet powerful API infrastructure.

### UPD 18.03.2022
I reviewed this repo first time since I abandoned it in Apr 2020. Please, keep in mind following things if you're reading this lines:
- the code is not finished yet
- if I would continue project right now, I would change some things like: add more stict typing in some cases, change structure, make code clearer, add phpstan or psalm, add tests and maybe CI integration.
